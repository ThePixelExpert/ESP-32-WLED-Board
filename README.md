# ESP-32 WLED Driver Board
### TODO: 

- [ ] make traces more efficient and more astetic


### Description:

    This project allows for a very compacat and power efficient solution for driving LED strips with WLED.  It takes a standard 12V input from a 2.5mm barrel jack,
    which gets converted to 5 and 3.3v for the LED's data, and ESP32 power.  It has mini USB support to allow for easy firmware upload without the use of UART headers.
    This version allows for 4 individual LED strips to be controlled simualtaniously through the use of a SN74HCT125RGYR level shifter and ESP32.  You can also change 
    whether you are powering the strips with 12V or 5V with the VC header but connecting the VCC (middle) pin to either voltage.  This product was intended for the use 
    of BTF-LIGHTING WS2811 and BTF-LIGHTING WS2812B LED strips.
### Instructions:
    TBD
